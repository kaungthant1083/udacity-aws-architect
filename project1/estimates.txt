In Disaster Recovery plan, we have to consider what is Recovery time objective (RTO) and what is recovery point objective. 

RTO define how many hours we can take to get our application or services available after a disaster. 

RPO define how much data you can loss based on hourly, it is same like how you back up your data. For example, if you define your RPO in 2 hours, it means you will lose 2 hours of data and you have backup for before 2 hours that can restore after disaster. 

1. Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage
   While a single Az is down, there will be DNS switching time to stand-by AZ and I think it can take a few mininutes (5 min to 10 min). As data is replicated synchronously, the stand-by has nearly real-time data.

2. Minimum RTO for a single region outage
   If our main region is down, we have to do read-replica in other region to serve as standalone primary database and also switching database endpoint of this other region database. So, we can assume switching read-replia to standalone for 20-30 mins and swithing database endpoints in applicaiton environemnt or some parameter store like AWS system manger parameter store for another 20-30 mins. After all, we can assume RTO will be 40 mins to 1 hours. 

3. Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage 
   During mutli-az setup, there will be automate backups and this backup will take once a day. There is good feature of AWS that is AWS has transactional log backup that take every 5 mins. This mean we can get back from this before 5 mins of a disaster. So, we can assume RPO can be 5 min to 10 min.

4. Minimum RPO for a single region outage 
   With using read-replic in other region, our database is using asynchronously to replicate data between read-replica and primarary. But there will be some delay and can't be real time data. So, we can assume at least 10-15 mins of data loss for single region outage.
