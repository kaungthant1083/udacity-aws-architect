Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

The following insights and recommendations we got from AWS Config, 
1. Have to check MFA on Root Account
2. Have to check for implementing password policy for IAM user
3. Checks whether the default security group for VPC is closed
4. Checks whether security groups that are in use disallow unrestricted incoming TCP traffic to the specified ports.

The following potential security issues we got from AWS Inspector
1. Minimum length for passwords is not configured on Web Server instance C3 in your assessment target.
2. Web Server Instance C3 is configured to allow users to log in with root credentials over SSH, without having to use a command authenticated by a public key. This increases the likelihood of a successful brute-force attack.
3. On Web Server Instance C3, process 'python3' is listening on UDP port 5000 which is reachable from the internet
4. On Web Server Instance C3, TCP port 20, 21, 23 which is associated with 'FTP' is reachable from the internet

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.

From recommendations of AWS Inspector, 
we should edit Web Server Security Group to remove access from the internet on port 20, 21, 23. 
We should configure your EC2 instance to prevent root account logins over SSH.
We should use Network ACL to prevent some kind of port accessing from Internet.
